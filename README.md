## How it works

- The app will generate random string for a room name.
- *Optional*: you can type a custom room in the URL
```?room=custom_room_name```
- Copy and Paste the URL including the room, and share it with a friend (or paste in another tab).
- When your friend visit the URL, you'll be prompted for access to your camera and mic*. Click "Accept".
- Click on a filter link under the video to change the filter for yourself and your friend.

***Note**: When using https you will only be prompted once and your browser will save the setting.
