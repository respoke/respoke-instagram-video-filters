```
?room=custom_room_name
```

- When your friend visit the URL, you'll be prompted for access to your camera and mic*. Click "Allow".
- Click on a filter link under the video to change the filter for yourself and your friend.

*Note: When using https you will only be prompted once and your browser will save the setting.
